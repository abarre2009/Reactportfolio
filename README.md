Hi! I'm Abdul. I'm a full-stack software developer.

I'm comfortable throughout the stack but my passion lies in the front end at the moment.
Recently graduated from the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp, I've been working in an I.T environment the last decade for a few companies on a variety of differenet technologies. I also have an Associates degree from North Hennepin Community College.
